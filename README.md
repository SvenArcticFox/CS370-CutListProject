# CS370-CutListProject
 
This is a group project for my software engineering class. The goal is to create a program that makes an optimum cut
list for a sheet of plywood. 

- _**Architectural Spike:**_ The part of the project where we try to find an approach to create a program that produces an optimum cut list. This involves research libraries and experimenting with them to see what sticks.
- _**src:**_ The main source code directory for the project. This will be used to build the project.
- _**Cycle1:**_ The code for cycle 1 of the project
- _**Cycle2:**_ The code for cycle 2 of the project.
- _**Cycle3:**_ The code for cycle 3 of the project
